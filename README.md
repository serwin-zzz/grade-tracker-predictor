# grade-tracker-predictor
 Web based university grade tracker/predictor which predicts grade based on previous performance on assignments.

Why did I create this?
- My university uses Canvas for online learning and its grade tracking facilities are not good. Also it doesn't have a
  grade prdeiction functionality which I wanted, rather than doing it manually every time.
- I also wanted to gain experience in developing an application with a client-server architecture as I want to learn
  more about web development because it so prominent in the current tech industry.

* This was created using XAMPP7 Windows and I recommend to use it if you want to try it on your own.

How to use:
- Download the PHP scripts and put them in the 'htdocs' folder of XAMPP
- Download the SQL script and run it using MySQL
- Use the 'Y2modules.txt' as an example data file to get started.
- Go to the localhost directory on your web browser and enjoy!
